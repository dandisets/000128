description: This dataset contains sorted unit spiking times and behavioral data from
  a macaque performing a delayed reaching task. The experimental task was a center-out
  reaching task with obstructing barriers forming a maze, resulting in a variety of
  straight and curved reaches. Neural activity was recorded from electrode arrays
  implanted in the motor cortex (M1) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). Cursor position,
  hand position, and eye position were also recorded during the experiment, and hand
  velocity was calculated offline from hand position.
